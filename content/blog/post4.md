In the past few hours, following recent events, some unverified reports about internet outages or disruptions in Iran have surfaced. However, as of now, no official statement has been released by [AFTA](https://afta.gov.ir/) or Passive Defense Organization.

The only update is from the Infrastructure Communications Company, which has informed Iranian data centers like Arvan, Asiatech, Pishgaman, and Hostiran that due to "infrastructure changes," from midnight until around 8 AM (UTC+03:30), Iranian servers and services may experience disruptions. These "infrastructure changes" could involve a variety of processes, and it's not confirmed whether it's specifically related to Iran's firewall or limiting access to most of Iran's bandwidth.

However, in the last few minutes, there's been an increase in latency (ping) towards some foreign IPs, particularly Cloudflare, as observed on [MahsaServer Radar](https://www.mahsaserver.com/radar/).

Overall, no major disruptions have been noticed yet in Iran's internet, but that doesn't mean the situation won't change in the next few hours or days.
