Since the afternoon of November 21st, a noticeable reduction in international bandwidth has been reported. This issue is clearly observable in [Cloudflare radar](https://radar.cloudflare.com/ir?dateStart=2024-11-14&dateEnd=2024-11-22) data, showing reduced traffic towards its services. Additionally, significant disruptions have been recorded on the [MahsaServer radar](https://mahsaserver.com/radar), further confirming the problem.

So far, there is no evidence of new changes to the national firewall or filtering policies. It appears that these disruptions are primarily related to a decline in overall quality and the bandwidth allocated for international connections. This reduction in quality has been observed across all major operators in the country, including MCI (Hamrah-e-Aval), IranCell, Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI), and even the main infrastructure (TIC) data center.
