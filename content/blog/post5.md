Since the afternoon of November 21st, a noticeable reduction in international bandwidth has been reported. This issue is clearly observable in Cloudflare radar data, showing reduced traffic towards its services. Additionally, significant disruptions have been recorded on the MahsaServer radar, further confirming the problem.

So far, there is no evidence of new changes to the national firewall or filtering policies. It appears that these disruptions are primarily related to a decline in overall quality and the bandwidth allocated for international connections. This reduction in quality has been observed across all major operators in the country, including MCI (Hamrah-e-Aval), IranCell, Telecommunication Company of Iran (TCI), and even the main infrastructure (TIC) data center.
